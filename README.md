<h2 id="started">📌 About </h2>

This is a To Do List project built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, aimed at practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage usage, and modern front-end techniques. It allows users to manage tasks easily and effectively with several useful features for personal organization.
🔧 Features:

    ✅ Add tasks with priority levels (low, medium, high), visually represented by colors (green, orange, red).
    📅 Each task includes a deadline field, automatically filled with the current date and fully editable by the user.
    ✏️ Inline editing of task names—just click and edit directly on the interface.
    🌗 Dark mode toggle with persistent theme using localStorage.
    ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts support (e.g., Enter, Delete).
    📦 Tasks are saved in localStorage, ensuring data persistence even after page refresh.
    🖱️ Manual sorting of tasks via drag and drop for full customization.

💡 Goal

The main goal of this project was to strengthen knowledge of modern JavaScript, apply front-end best practices, and build a functional UI with a focus on usability and user experience.
